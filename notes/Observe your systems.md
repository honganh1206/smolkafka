# Observe your systems

We make our systems _observable_ so we can ask questions that will give us insight into the system & debug unexpected (never happen before) problems.

## Three types of telemetry data

[[Metrics]], [[Structured logs]], and [[Traces]]

We will use OpenCensus libraries in our service since OpenCensus's gRPC integration support both metrics and traces.
